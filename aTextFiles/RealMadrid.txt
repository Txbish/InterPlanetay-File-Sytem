
Real Madrid Club de Fútbol, founded in 1902, stands as one of the world's most illustrious football clubs. Bestowed with the "Real" title by King Alfonso XIII in 1920, Real Madrid achieved unprecedented success under the presidency of Santiago Bernabéu in the 1950s, winning five consecutive European Cups. The "Galácticos" era saw the club sign global football stars, and in 2009, the acquisition of Cristiano Ronaldo marked a new era of triumph. Under managers like José Mourinho and Zinedine Zidane, Real Madrid secured four Champions League titles in five seasons from 2013 to 2018. The club's historic rivalry with FC Barcelona and its iconic Santiago Bernabéu Stadium further solidify its legacy in football history. Known for its white kit and commitment to excellence, Real Madrid remains a symbol of success with a vast global fanbase. Please note that developments in the club's history may have occurred since my last update in January 2022.
