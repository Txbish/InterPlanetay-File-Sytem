Impressionism, a 19th-century art movement, sought to capture the essence of a scene through light and color. Rejecting traditional techniques, artists like Claude Monet and Edgar Degas pioneered this movement. Their works, characterized by loose brushstrokes and emphasis on atmosphere, ushered in a new era in art, challenging conventions and influencing subsequent movements.
