Deforestation, the large-scale removal of forests, has significant environmental consequences. Beyond the loss of biodiversity, deforestation contributes to climate change, disrupts ecosystems, and affects indigenous communities. Conservation efforts and sustainable forestry practices are crucial to mitigate the adverse effects and preserve the vital role forests play in maintaining planetary health.
